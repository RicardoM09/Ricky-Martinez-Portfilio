    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year since 1999 thousands of young aspiring Pokemon masters leave their homes in an effort to \"catch em all\" with nothing more than the clothes on their back and a Pokedex. However, as time passes there seems to be an ever growing number of species. It can daunting to encounter an unknown species for the first time. This project explores using predictive models to help a Pokedex classify unknown Pokemon and predict the probability of catching this new creature. As a further step, can this new species be classified as a \"Legenday\" type. "

    "**How does this tie into machine learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few machine learning methods that can be used on this data. To first predict a Pokemon's catch rate we can implement a multivariate linear regression to get a discrete result. To then predict if a Pokemon is legendary type we can convert a boolean feature to binary and run a logistic regression. Both will require feature selection methods to reduce the number of variables that come into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly, the Pokemon universe does a great job of classifying species by color, body type, attribute type, etc. It would be interesting to implement clustering techniques to identify any new types of classifications that we can begin to group Pokemon by outside of the existing attributes.

Intuitively, I can elimate a few features that I don't think will play much role in my model but looking at the data I am not sure the best technique to eliminate redundant features. I plan on exploring lasso, random forest's importance score and PCA techniques to maximize predictive power.\n",
